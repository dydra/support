How to Contact Dydra's Support Team
===================================

To contact Dydra's support team, use one of the following two methods:

1. If possible, open a new ticket in our public issue tracker hosted at
   GitHub: https://github.com/dydra/support/issues

   To avoid duplicate tickets, please do make sure to have a look whether
   your issue might already have been reported by another user; in that
   case, do comment on the existing ticket so that we know how many users
   the ticket affects and can prioritize it accordingly.

2. Otherwise (for example, if any information relating to the issue is
   confidential), email us at support@dydra.com.

   Please make sure to clearly indicate your Dydra account and/or repository
   name.

PS. If this is your first time reporting a bug, please have a read for
`how to report bugs effectively`__.
